Building a project for Personal Budget Tracking.

THE MAIN CODE IS IN THE INDEX.HTML FILE. WE HAVE LINKED ALL THE WEBPAGES TO THAT ONLY. SO, TO ACCESS OUR PROJECT, MAKE SURE TO ADD ALL THE GIVEN FILES IN A COMMON FOLDER AND THEN USE THE INDEX.HTML FILE TO FINALLY OPEN THE DESIRED WEBPAGE. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:-

Since we are just a bunch of novices in this particular field, we have used HTML5 and CSS3 to create the landing page of our project.
Furthermore, we have tried to make our website as responsive and as user friendly as we could.
Up until now, we have build the landing page of our project which is a little bit interactive.
We aim to make it as interactive as we can before the submission time.

Initially, before the first phase, we almost completed our landing page. The footer of the front page was not yet done.
So, after the first phase, we completed our landing page, started working on making the website interactive and taking input from the user.
We made some more webpages sections like blogs, about us, etc. and linked it to our main landing page. 
Up until yet, we have completed our first page and different team members are working on different parts of the project. 
Before the beginning of the second phase, we finished the different webpages to be linked with the landing page of our project and started working on the main tool which is the Budget Tracker.

After the second phase, we were done with the Budget Tracker tool too. So, now, the only thing we had to do is link all the webpages together. 
We overall completed our project and then we uploaded it in our repository. Hope you like it!
