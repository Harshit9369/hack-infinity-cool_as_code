# hack-infinity-cool_as_code
Building a project for personal budget tracking.
Since we are just a bunch of novices in this particular field, we have used HTML5 and CSS3 to create the landing page of our project.
Furthermore, we have tried to make our website as responsive and as user friendly as we could.
Up until now, we have build the landing page of our project which is a little bit interactive.
We aim to make it as interactive as we can before the submission time.
